# NC News 


## TLDR (Too Long, Didn't Read)

NC News is a social news aggregation, web content rating, and discussion website.

It interacts with an [API](https://garysum-news.herokuapp.com/api) which was developed during my backend project in Northcoders Bootcamp course and was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Background

NC News has articles which are divided into topics. Each article has user curated ratings and can be up or down voted using the API. Users can also add comments about an article.

In this app, an user can:
- view a list of all available articles
- view a seperate page for each topic with a list of related articles
- view a list of articles with different display options (sort by date/title/topic/author/votes , ascending or descending order)
- view an individual airticle
- vote on an article
- post a comment to an article (once logged in) 
- delete a comment that is posted by the user (once logged in) 
- review the basic information of an user (username, name and avatar image)
